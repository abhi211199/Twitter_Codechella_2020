## What it does
- Trees periodically tweet about pollution updates at a particular location!
- An user can ask a particular tree about the pollution level at a particular location. Seeing the response, people may get motivated about the tree's feelings.
## How we built it
- We used Twitter  API to create virtual profiles(using my own profile for the timing) for trees at particular locations.
- The trees post updates about the pollution levels at particular locations periodically.
- Tweepy library(update_status and StreamListener) was used to implement the bot.
